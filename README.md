# BepisPlugins
A collection of essential [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) plugins for Koikatu. Most importantly this collection includes a screenshot plugin, slider and input field unlockers. This collection also includes Sideloader for loading mods.

## Releases

[![Github Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bbepis/BepisPlugins/latest/total.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins/releases)

These plugins require the latest bleeding edge build of [BepInEx](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be). The latest release versions of BepInEx will not work.

## Plugin descriptions
### BGMLoader
Loads custom BGMs and clips played on game startup. Stock audio is replaced during runtime by custom clips from BepInEx\BGM and BepInEx\IntroClips directories.

### ColorCorrector
(Koikatsu)

Allows configuration of some post-processing filters. (change of bloom amount, disable saturation filter)

### ExtensibleSaveFormat
Allows additional data to be saved to character, coordinate and scene cards. The cards are fully compatible with non-modded game, the additional data is lost in that case. This is used by sideloader to store used mod information.

### InputUnlocker
Allows user to input longer than normal values to InputFields. This allows longer names and other properties stored as text.

### Screencap
Creates screenshots based on settings. Can create screenshots of much higher resolution than what the game is running at. It can make screen (F9 key) or character (F11 key) screenshots.

### Sideloader
Loads mods packaged in .zip archives from the Mods directory without modifying the game files at all. You don't unzip them, just drag and drop to Mods folder in the game root.

It prevents mods from colliding with each other (i.e. 2 mods have same item IDs and can't coexist; sideloader automatically assigns correct IDs). It also makes it easy to disable/remove mods with no lasting effects on your game install (just remove the .zip, no game files are changed at any point).
